=============
## Quit from Alt Tab 
* This is just a quick basic injection, if anybody wants to pick this up just fork away and send me a pull request :)
* UUID: gse-quitfromalttab@upinthesky.net
* Version: 0.1

### 0.2
* Initial Version
* Add Close Buttons to Single Instance Windows that actually close stuff :)
* Add Close Buttons to multiple Instances too

### TODO
* Write a custom wrapper for AppSwitcherPopup that will also redraw stuff after closing an App
* Make Close Buttons respect the LTR/RTL setting of GS (cause right now its just hacky)
* Make Close Buttons only appear on focused App/Windows??
* Implement a 'q' keybinding to close the focused App
